# ETL Project | Telecom Use Case

## Overview

This project involves designing and implementing an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for telecom data. The pipeline extracts large volumes of call data records (CDRs) from multiple sources, cleans and transforms the data, and loads it into a structured data warehouse for analysis. The project aims to automate the ETL process and ensure the timely and accurate updating of the data warehouse for business intelligence purposes.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: Extracts large volumes of call data records from multiple sources.
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans and transforms raw telecom data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Data Storage**: Stores cleaned and transformed data in a well-organized data warehouse.
- **Automation**: Automates the ETL pipeline using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), ensuring regular updates to the data warehouse.
- **Analysis**: Supports analytical needs, such as querying and reporting, for telecom business insights.

## Project Components

1. **Data Extraction**: 
   - Extracts data from various telecom systems (e.g., customer service records, billing systems).
   - Handles large datasets and integrates data from diverse formats (CSV, SQL databases).

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Applies necessary transformations, including:
     - Data cleaning (removing duplicates, handling missing values).
     - Formatting and standardizing fields (e.g., converting time zones, adjusting currency).
     - Calculating new derived metrics, such as average call duration or total usage by customer.

3. **Data Warehouse Design**:
   - Designed a data warehouse structure tailored to telecom data.
   - Organized data into fact tables (e.g., Call Records, Customer Info) and dimension tables (e.g., Date, Customer Demographics).
   - Optimized the data warehouse for analytical queries and reporting.

4. **Automation with SSIS**:
   - Built an automated ETL pipeline using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).
   - Scheduled ETL jobs to run at regular intervals to keep the data warehouse updated.
   - Automated error handling and logging to monitor the ETL process.

## Technologies Used

- **ETL Tools**: SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- **Database**: SQL Server
- **Data Warehouse Design**: Star schema with fact and dimension tables
- **Data Formats**: CSV, SQL, and other structured telecom data formats
- **Programming Languages**: SQL for transformations, T-SQL for querying
- **Tools for Reporting**: SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), Power BI (if applicable)

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Set Up SQL Server Database

1. Create a new SQL Server database for the telecom data warehouse.
2. Design tables based on the warehouse schema, including fact tables (e.g., `CallRecords`, `Billing`) and dimension tables (e.g., `Date`, `Customer`).
3. Import the data sources into staging tables for preprocessing.

### 2. Extract Data from Multiple Sources

1. Use SSIS to create an extraction process for each data source (e.g., CSV files, third-party telecom systems).
2. Ensure that the correct data extraction logic is in place, such as incremental loading or full reloads, depending on the data type.

### 3. Transform the Data

1. Define the transformation steps in SSIS, including data cleaning (e.g., removing duplicates, fixing data formats).
2. Standardize fields such as customer IDs, time zones, and currencies to ensure consistency across all data.
3. Create new derived metrics, if needed, such as total call duration or customer usage statistics.

### 4. Load Data into Data Warehouse

1. After data transformation, load the cleaned and standardized data into the appropriate fact and dimension tables in the data warehouse.
2. Set up SSIS to handle errors and log issues for each data load.

### 5. Automate the ETL Pipeline

1. Schedule the ETL process using SSIS to run at specific intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
2. Set up notifications for failed jobs and automate error logging.

### 6. Reporting and Analysis

1. Use tools like SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) or Power BI to create reports and dashboards that provide actionable insights into the telecom data.
2. Set up queries to analyze metrics such as total call volume, average call duration, and customer usage patterns.

## Project Outcome

The ETL pipeline ensures:
- Reliable and consistent telecom data for analysis.
- Automated updates to the data warehouse, minimizing manual intervention.
- Real-time insights into telecom metrics for business intelligence.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate additional data sources for deeper analysis.
- Enhance the data transformation process by incorporating machine learning for predictive analytics.
- Extend the automation to include monitoring and alerting for potential ETL issues.
